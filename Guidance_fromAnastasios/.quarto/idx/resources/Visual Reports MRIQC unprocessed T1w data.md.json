For more details see document: Visual Reports MRIQC Unprocessed BOLD data + small intro in the notes of this paper\n\n\\--> Note that normalization and co-registration are relative robust to structural images with mild artifacts, therefore it is not always absolute necessity to impose exclusion criteria on the unprocessed T1w images.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n[image]\n\n- **Motion - related and Gibbs ringing: Large head motion during the acquisition of T1w images often expresses itself with the appearance of concentric ripples throughout the scan**\n    \n    \\--> **Gibbs ringing:** is a consequence of the truncation of the Fourier series approximation and appears as **multiple fine lines immediately adjacent and parallel to high contrast interfaces.** But it is the same with subtle cases of motion related issues.\n    \n    **\\--> The ripples cause by motion** generally span the whole brain and are primarily visible in the **sagittal view fo MRIQC’s mosaic view**\n    \n\n**For an example see the above image: Figure S10E**\n\n- **Intensity non-uniformity: is characterized by a smooth variation (low spatial frequency) of intensity throughout the brain caused by the strongel signal sensed in the proximity of coils.**\n    \n    - **Where -->** On the zoomed-in vie on the T1w image\n    - Can be a problem for automated processing methods that assume a type of tissue [e.g. white matter (WM)] is represented by voxels of similar intensities across the whole brain.\n    - An extreme intensity non-uniformity can also be a sign of coil failure\n\n**For an example see the above image Figure S10F**\n\n- **Eye spillover: Eye movements may trigger the signal leakage from the eyes through the imaging axes with the lowest bandwidth (i.e., acquired faster), potentially overlapping signal from brain tissue.**\n    \n    - A strong signal leakage can however be noticeable on the zoomed-in view of the T1w image\n    - In defaced data the leakage might not be visible\n\n**For an example see the above image Figure S10G**\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nInterpretation of the visual reports of the T1w images based on ([“Introduction to MRIQC [TRAIN-05-2022]”, 2022](zotero://select/library/items/GBRPHHIX))\n\n- **Zoomed-in mosaic view of the brain --> zoomed in brain masks of the T1w images in a horzontal view**\n    \n    - We want **high contrast between the grey matter and the white matter**\n    - We also have to check for **ringing artifacts**\n        \n- **Background Noise**\n    \n    - Yellow and green are areas with high background noise\n    - Dark purple are areas with lwo background noise\n\nAreas like:\n\n        1) The teeth\n\n        2) Sinus cavities            --> are areas with high background noise\n\n        3) Air canals\n\n[image]\n\n**But: whenever you get in the brain you don’t really want any noise, you want that all purple**\n\n[image]\n\n**\\--> And same thing for the saggital view**\n\n[image]","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Visual
