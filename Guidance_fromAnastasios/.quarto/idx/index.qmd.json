Quality assessment (QA):\n\n-   Focuses on ensuring the research workflow produces data of “sufficient quality” (e.g identifying a structures artifact caused by an environmental condition that can be actioned upon so that **it doesn’t replicate prospectively in future acquisitions).**\n\n### Quality control (QC):\n\n-   **Excludes poor-quality data from the dataset** so that they do not continue through the research workflow and potentially bias the results\n\n--\\> QA/QC checkpoints are mostly unstandardized and typically involve the screening of the images one by one.\n\n--\\> **Raters:** individual researchers that repeatedly screening data\n\n## Methods\n\n-   Assessing the unprocessed data using the MRIQC visual reports\n\n-   Assess the results with minimal preprocessing using hte fMRIPrep visual reports.\n\n### Assessment of quality aspects and exclusion criteria\n\n-   All based on the visual inspection of the individual MRIQCC and fMRIPrep eports, so they are all qualitative.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"self-contained":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
