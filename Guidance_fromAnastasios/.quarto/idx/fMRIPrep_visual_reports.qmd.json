In general DVARS and FD are good ways to account for signal caused by motion artifacts\n\n### Smoothing\n\n**Important Note:** Smoothing is not in the pipeline of fmriprep, therefore it is a step that has to be executed after running the fmriprep pipeline.\n\n-   Smoothing has been ommited by design. The fmriprep does not make assumption on how you are going to analyze your data\n\n    -   e.g. Some MVPA studies do not do any smoothing at all before the first level analysis\n\n-   The amount of smoothing is a matter of judgement\n\n    -   Experiments that are focused on larger cortical areas, probably want to use larger smoothing kernels\n\n[**Tip:**]{style=\"color:red;\"} **Since we have multiple tasks with different goals, smoothing should be executed with this in mind and probably individually for each task/goal. When performing that use a prefix (e.g. smo0.8 or sth along those lines) in the name of the data so it is quite clear and easy to find what was the smoothing!**\n\n## ToDO\n\n-   [ ] fix the video in normalization section as it is not working.
