## Visual Reports MRIQC unprocessed T1w data

In this document we will make notes on how to interpret the visual reports of MRIQC specifically for T1w data.

### Common artifacts with [bold data](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd)

**For:**

1.  [**Artifactual structures in the background**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#artifactual-structures-in-the-background)

2.  [**Susceptibility distortion artifacts**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#susceptibility-distortion-artifacts)

    1.  **Signal drop-out**
    2.  **Brain distortions**

3.  [**Aliasing ghost**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#aliasing-ghosts)

4.  [**Wrap-around that overlaps with the brain**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#wrap-around-artifacts)

5.  [**Data formatting issues**](MRIQC_BOLD.qmd#data-formatting-issues)

-   Description is the same as the BOLD reports.

-   Note that normalization and co-registration are relative robust to structural images with mild artifacts, therefore it is not always absolute necessity to impose exclusion criteria on the unprocessed T1w images.

**Examples:**

### Motion - related and Gibbs ringing:

**Large head motion during the acquisition of T1w images often expresses itself with the appearance of concentric ripples throughout the scan**

-   **Gibbs ringing:** is a consequence of the truncation of the Fourier series approximation and appears as **multiple fine lines immediately adjacent and parallel to high contrast interfaces.** But it is the same with subtle cases of motion related issues.

-   **The ripples cause by motion** generally span the whole brain and are primarily visible in the **sagittal view fo MRIQC’s mosaic view**

**For an example see the above image: [Figure S10E](#fig_s10)**

### Intensity non-uniformity:

-   **Is characterized by a smooth variation (low spatial frequency) of intensity throughout the brain caused by the strongel signal sensed in the proximity of coils.**

    -   **Where:** On the zoomed-in view on the T1w image
    -   Can be a problem for automated processing methods that assume a type of tissue \[e.g. white matter (WM)\] is represented by voxels of similar intensities across the whole brain.
    -   An extreme intensity non-uniformity can also be a sign of coil failure

**For an example see the above image [Figure S10F](#fig_s10)**

### Eye spillover

-   **Eye movements may trigger the signal leakage from the eyes through the imaging axes with the lowest bandwidth (i.e., acquired faster), potentially overlapping signal from brain tissue.**

    -   A strong signal leakage can however be noticeable on the zoomed-in view of the T1w image
    -   In defaced data the leakage might not be visible

**For an example see the above image [Figure S10G](#fig_s10)**

## Other Notes on Interpretation

Interpretation of the visual reports of the T1w images based on [@introduc]

### Zoomed-in mosaic view of the brain

-   Zoomed in brain masks of the T1w images in a horzontal view

    -   We want **high contrast between the grey matter and the white matter**

    -   We also have to check for **ringing artifacts**

### Background noise

-   Yellow and green are areas with high background noise

-   Dark purple are areas with lwo background noise

Areas like:

1.  The teeth

2.  Sinus cavities

3.  Air canals

-   Are areas with high background noise

**Example:**

[**But:**]{.underline} **whenever you get in the brain you don’t really want any noise, you want that all purple**

**Example:**

![](resources/BG_noise_02.png)

**And same thing for the saggital view**

**Example:**
